# 3D Backrooms Shooter Game

This repository is for the 3D Shooter activity for my "Programming for Games" discipline in my IT course, we were tasked to create a level 2 for the game that the teacher created with us in class, so we could still use his assets and scripts, but we would have to be somewhat creative.

My idea was to create a game that you could move freely in a Backrooms themed map and your enemies would be nextbots-like enemies of a skull and a ghost. Didn't did too much creative stuff for the scripts as I adapted some from older projects and also had to face a lot of bugs due to Unity's shadering system and some broken scripts that I reused from the discipline past projects. So yes, it's my worst project (I had to submit and present it with some very bad bugs) but I got a good grade on it for my creativity.
